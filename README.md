# chime_nt36672a_truly_dtb_fix

A little script to replace dtb with stock MIUI 12.5.8 blobs while retaining currently installed kernel. Fixes black screen on boot with NT36672a Truly V2 panel (maybe also macro camera).

Fkash tihs immediately after faulty ROM or kernel.

This may become obsolete at any time.

You can use your own favourite version by (re)placing boot.img and dtbo.img in the root of the zip file.
