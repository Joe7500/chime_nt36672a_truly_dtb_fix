# chime_nt36672a_truly_dtb_fix

A little script to replace dtb/o with stock MIUI_12.5.8_Global blobs while retaining currently installed kernel. Fixes black screen on boot with NT36672a Truly V2 panel.

- Flash this immediately after flashing a faulty ROM or kernel.
- This may become obsolete at any time.

Format data is recommended.

You can use your own favourite dtb/o version by (re)placing boot.img and dtbo.img in the root of the zip file.
